Description: This notebook demonstrates how to do timeseries classification using a Transformer model.
Accelerator: GPU
"""

"""
## Introduction

This is the Transformer architecture from
[Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762),
applied to timeseries instead of natural language.

This example requires TensorFlow 2.4 or higher.

## Load the dataset

We are going to use the same dataset and preprocessing as the
[TimeSeries Classification from Scratch](https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_classification_from_scratch)
example.

    )(inputs, inputs)

"""
The main part of our model is now complete. We can stack multiple of those
`transformer_encoder` blocks and we can also proceed to add the final
Multi-Layer Perceptron classification head. Apart from a stack of `Dense`
layers, we need to reduce the output tensor of the `TransformerEncoder` part of
our model down to a vector of features for each data point in the current
batch. A common way to achieve this is to use a pooling layer. For
this example, a `GlobalAveragePooling1D` layer is sufficient.
